Objective: Create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

""Requirements:""
------------------------
""User Input:""

The program should prompt the user to choose an operation from the following list:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exit
Input Validation:

Ensure that the user inputs valid numbers for the calculations. If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric), prompt the user to enter the numbers again.
Performing Calculations:

Based on the user's choice, the program should ask for two numbers and perform the selected operation.
If the user selects division, check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.
Looping:

After each calculation, ask the user if they want to perform another calculation. If they answer "yes," return to the operation selection; if they answer "no," exit the program.
Output:

Display the result of the calculation in a user-friendly format.
For example: "The result of adding 5 and 3 is 8."
Exit Option:

If the user chooses to exit, print a thank you message and terminate the program.

Task-2
 Folder Operations with Files
In this exercise, we will implement a function that performs the following steps:

Open a folder: The function will work on a folder specified by the user or a pre-defined folder.
Create multiple files: A specified number of files will be created inside this folder.
Check the number of files: The function will calculate and return the total number of files present in the folder after creation.
Delete half of the files randomly: The function will delete approximately half of the files from the folder in a random manner.
Check the result: After deleting the files, the function will again calculate and display the remaining number of files in the folder.

Steps Breakdown:
Open/Make a folder: This checks if the folder exists, if not, it creates one.
Create files: Inside the folder, it generates the specified number of .txt files.
Check file count: It counts how many files are in the folder after creation.
Delete half the files randomly: Randomly selects and deletes half of the files.
Final check: It then shows how many files are left.
